# Employee-Application
This application allows an employee of a company to log their information into the company site. The program displays a menu of employment types of which the user is to select. The user then inputs their employment information according to the prompts that follow. Once completed, the information is logged into the program as Payroll information. The main method for this program can be found in the Payroll class located in the Payroll.java file.


To run this program please download the source code via the src files and compile using a JRE.

This was a class assignment that I completed for my Full Stack Development Apprenticeship with Xpanxion.

If you have any suggestions on how I might be able to build upon or improve this program, I am open to receiving feedback!

Thank you,
